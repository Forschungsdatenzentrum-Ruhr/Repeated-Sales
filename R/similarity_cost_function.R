  # the gains calculation

  # Explanation + Prep ------------------------------------------------------

  # each observation can only be a parent or child, never both
  # to dissolve this conflict compare similarity gains from each case
  # another way to think about it: similarity is lost if the other option is chosen

  # unique deals with a parent being chosen as such from multiple cluster
  # since the parent is the same either way, no special consideration is necessary

  # clean_up of NAs ---------------------------------------------------------

  # deal with NAs, these should always have at least themselves as well as
  # another potential parent -> choose minimal sim_dist that isnt NA
  # NOTE: check git if simple solution isnt working - just dropping NAs should
  # work out fine, since competing parents are sorted out later anyway
  # for full explanation of why/how this occurs refer to cluster_class.R
