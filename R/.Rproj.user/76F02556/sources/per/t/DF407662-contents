# Follow the comments below to fill in this target script.
# Then follow the manual to check and run the pipeline:

# Load packages required to define the pipeline:
library(targets)

# Set target options:
library_string = c("here", # creating dynamic paths based on script location
                   "haven", # reading/writing of dta files
                   "tidyverse", # data manipulation/wrangeling
                   "doParallel", #parallel processing
                   "foreach", #parallel looping
                   "magrittr", #two sided pipe

# tar_make_clustermq() configuration (okay to leave alone):

# tar_make_future() configuration (okay to leave alone):
# Install packages {{future}}, {{future.callr}}, and {{future.batchtools}} to allow use_targets() to configure tar_make_future() options.
